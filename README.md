  ## Description 
 This app is a simple 10-question quiz for anyone studying Python (speaking from experience—great for locking in those concepts as a bootcamp student!). One of its standout features is the clean workflow behind the scenes: feature branches merge into develop, then into main, which auto-deploys to Render. It keeps the code tidy, releases smooth, and makes testing way more efficient!
